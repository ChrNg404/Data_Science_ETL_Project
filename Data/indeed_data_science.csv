Here are some of the things we do​:

We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses on client data to assess diversity and inclusion across the employee lifecycle, from how companies attract and hire people to how they develop and retain their workforce. This includes meeting with clients to explain our data needs, conducting a wide range of analyses on data from multiple sources, and contributing to written reports and presentations.

You love explaining complex concepts to non-technical audiences.
You have prior work experience as a data scientist (this is ideal, but not required)

Other Skills:

You're proactive. When you don't know how to do something, you're motivated to do the work to figure it out.
You care about the details. You develop processes to double check your work, and have experience working in a role where you were responsible for giving attention to detail. For example, you build checks into your analyses to help catch mistakes and proofread work before finalizing.
You're comfortable balancing multiple projects at once. You can move quickly from one project to the next, even if they require different skills (for example, jumping from a strategy call with the Paradigm team to conducting in-depth analyses).
You acknowledge when you've made a mistake. You talk openly about mistakes and make plans to improve and avoid similar mistakes in the future.
You enjoy working both independently and collaboratively on data-related projects.

Details: ​This is a full-time role based in San Francisco. We offer competitive salaries, equity, and benefits, including healthcare, vision, dental, and a 401(k) with employer matching.

Principal Data Scientists within RSS helps drive forward R&D activity by providing a deep level of insight into experimental data, its interpretation and implications for project development efforts. Principal data scientists combine a number of skills from different domains to organize, process, and learn from data, often through the lens of domain-expert informed models that help to abstract concepts from the data, test their validity and make predictions.

The principal data scientist must then synthesize insights from this data and communicate it to internal customers in a way that is both approachable and informative. Given a need for routine analysis by internal customers following a pilot study by the data scientist, the principal data scientist then integrates the necessary analytical or inferential routines into a pipeline through a collaborate software engineering effort, resulting in a validated internal software product that may be used regularly by experimentalist to track their research effort's progress. The principal data scientist may also have scientific expertise in the field of study, often to great advantage for the purpose of this role, though not necessarily at the level of the experimental scientist / customer. Alternatively, the principle data scientist may have little or no scientific expertise in that particular domain but bring an extremely advanced set of skills in the areas of machine learning, deep learning, statistical modeling, signal processing, data engineering, software engineering etc., such that they are generally advantageous members of a project or subproject team regardless of the scientific domain of the problem.

Finally, in some cases, a principal data scientist may be even more specialized with regards to the research, development, or correct implementation of the most advanced versions of the skills and technical approaches in the areas formerly listed, that his/her role requires little or no interaction with experimental groups and is instead focused entirely on advancing the core competencies, tools sets, infrastructures, and processes within the data science organization(s) of RSS.

About The I School
UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.
The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.
We offer professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our on-campus master’s program (MIMS) trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our web-based master’s program (MIDS) is the first and only degree available completely online to train data science professionals. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to contribute to knowledge and to the policies that influence the organization, use, and sharing of information.
Our graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.

Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.
We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the world's largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
We are looking for an intellectually curious person, who has the drive to create sophisticated algorithms that can be translated efficiently to a scalable framework. We value self-driven can-do people that are sticklers for writing quality code over writing code quickly to get the job done. The ideal candidate will have a deep interest in data science, good communication skills, and generally have a positive vibe. Perhaps most importantly, we are looking for someone with a strong sense of customer empathy who understands that accuracy matters and also has the desire to influence the product direction.

Data Engineering and Infrastructure
Netflix makes up 1/3 of internet traffic, and we're proud to deliver entertainment that over 125 million global customers enjoy. Behind the scenes, Netflix is delivered by Open Connect, a custom-built content delivery network that connects our content to thousands of ISPs around the world.

Decisions on how to improve streaming performance for our customers and evolve Open Connect's architecture are driven by data. We're looking for someone to transform petabytes of incoming data on video performance and network efficiency into well-designed, high-quality data structures that empower critical decision-making for teams within Netflix.

We track every customer action and each byte of data transferred, so you'll work with data at incredible scale and collaborate with best-in-class data engineers and analytic experts. You'll become an authority in the world of video streaming delivery (no prior knowledge necessary, but curiosity to learn is a must), and the projects you'll work on will be truly impactful.
In the meantime, learn more about the Streaming Data Engineering team.
What you'll do
You’ll take ownership and increase automation and scale of complex data sets that drive use cases by our analytical partners such as hardware capacity planning and failure prediction, understanding network topology and forecasting network traffic flow, and monitoring/improving efficiency of deployment and turnover of Netflix-encoded assets to the network.
You’ll build robust data pipelines of high data quality in a scalable fashion (both data and maintainability).
Every video or audio file you stream from Netflix started as a file living on an editor’s hard drive and became a Netflix-encoded asset sitting on a server ready to be played. You’ll create the data pipelines that will let us quantify and understand that life cycle by merging system activity and customer behavior.
We need to process data more quickly than ever to enable rapid experimentation in an increasingly nimble engineering organization. You’ll help implement our business logic to be compatible with real-time/stream processing frameworks.
Who you are
Have several of the characteristics/skills listed below and have passion and self-drive to quickly learn in areas of less familiarity. We believe the experience in your years is more important than your years of experience.
Enjoy a high level of autonomy in managing cross-functional engineering projects. We enjoy a culture of Freedom & Responsibility.
Have experience building production data pipelines using one or more frameworks such as Spark, Flink or Hive/Hadoop. Have hands on experience with schema design and data modeling.
Have programming proficiency in at least one major language such as Java, Scala or Python. You have a software engineering mindset and strive to write elegant, maintainable code and you're comfortable working in a variety of tech stacks. You may even be a software engineer with a focus or passion for data-driven solutions.
Have strong SQL skills and knowledge and familiarity with other distributed data stores such as ElasticSearch or Druid.
Have excellent communication in sharing context to effectively collaborate with analytical partners, domain experts and other consumers of your work, preferably in supporting an engineering or product function. We like to collaborate across teams and so should you.
Ambitious and willing to take action, but not stubborn. Awareness to recognize when you're wrong and move past your own mistakes. We are humbly confident in ourselves and our work.
Netflix Culture

Our culture is unique, and we live by our values. You will need to be comfortable working in the most agile of environments. Requirements will be vague, and iterations will be rapid. You will need to be nimble and take smart risks. Learn more about Netflix’s culture."

At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community. Industry wide, we’ve seen Stories as a new sharing/consumption format rise.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values
----------

We believe we can help build a future for everyone.


We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.

Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity
---------------

Our mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Interdisciplinary teams of physicians, biologists, computational scientists, and engineers can expand our understanding of the human body and illness — the very science behind medicine. CZI fosters collaboration between scientists and engineers, develops tools and technologies, and builds support for basic scientific research.

The ideal candidate will have a background in a quantitative or technical field and experience working with large data sets and making data-driven decisions. If you are mission-driven, entrepreneurial, and committed to building transformative technologies, we want to hear from you.

Meta is a product that helps biomedical researchers discover literature that's important to their work and delivers it in real-time to their personal feeds. Meta uses artificial intelligence to organize and track over 67 million biomedical diseases, genes, proteins, techniques, researchers, journals, papers, preprints, and more—including full coverage of PubMed and bioRxiv. We believe that the complexity and scale of scientific knowledge is limiting how quickly researchers can understand, navigate and quickly make powerful connections across what is know. This is one of the fundamental challenges hindering the rate of discovery in basic scientific research.

As Data Scientist for Meta, you'll be helping bring Meta to the broader community of researchers around the world. If you want to make a difference and help accelerate innovation in science, come and join us!

Job Details
Manager, Data Science or Manager, Machine Learning

The Einstein Platform Team at Salesforce is looking for Data Science Managers and Machine Learning Managers to help us in our mission to democratize data science and to make it accessible to people without machine learning PhDs while solving for accuracy, usability and scale. No, really!


Hundreds of thousands of businesses use Salesforce everyday to manage all kinds of customer needs, and a majority of them do not have data science or engineering teams to help them take full advantage of all their data. Our mission is to change this, and truly transform the way businesses operate. We have some very unique technical challenges to solve along the way that stem from Enterprise scale diversity — diversity of data, of use cases, and of business processes.


The ideal candidate will be:
Technical - Our job is to power lots and lots data science use cases. You need to live and breathe data and have a very informed opinion on the various alternatives for machine learning frameworks and architectures for solving machine learning use cases. We don't expect you to be the most technical person on your team, but there is a pretty high minimum bar that you must pass to be useful to the team, and help influence the team to make the right technical decisions.
A Leader - You are a natural leader, who can mentor and coach engineers on the team to be able to handle bigger challenges, find fulfillment in their work, and execute on the product growth goals through collaboration to do the best work of their lives.
Experienced - The only way to learn people leadership, is by experience. We will need you to bring that experience. We want the best people who spend large portions of their time thinking about how to hire, motivate and retain the best.

Here is why it is worth it:
People - you will get to work with truly some of the best people and hopefully learn a lot
Challenge - our team has experience working in some of the most famous companies in the world, and none of us ever faced the challenges that we are solving for now.
Spotlight - Dreamforce is the largest technology conference in the world (170,000 attendees in 2015). And our work will be on the center stage.
Open Source - we believe in open source and the self actualization engineers get from having their work be used by others. One of our open source projects is the most starred Scala GitHub repo (more than Spark, Play and Scala itself!) and amongst the top 5 most starred Machine Learning projects (right there with TensorFlow and Scikit Learn). The other has been one of the top trending Scala repos on Github since we launched it in August.
Perks - we compete with the best here.

Core Qualifications:
BS, MS, or PhD in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience
3+ years of hands-on experience developing production-ready machine learning driven products such as recommender systems or search ranking system
2+ years of experience as a people manager managing data scientists or machine learning engineers
Solid foundation in machine learning and statistics
Track record of leading highly impactful projects from conception to finish

Preferred Qualifications
Experience in JVM based languages (Java, Scala)
Experience with open source projects such as Spark and Hadoop

If you think this is the right job for you, and you are the right person for the job, please write and share with us a couple of paragraphs on why you think you would like this job and why you think you are the right person.

LiveRamp powers exceptional experiences by making it safe and easy to connect the world's data, people, and applications. We are the industry pace-setter and one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses anywhere—the enabling product behind many of the world's biggest brands and technology platforms.

We recently debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: RAMP) as an independent public company. Our fundamentals are exceptional: 30%+ annual revenue growth, $1.7B in cash, no debt, and over 600 customers. And we're growing our team at a record pace. Want to build the future with 750 savvy, curious LiveRampers across the U.S., Europe, and APAC? Join us!

Identity Research Data Scientist

Do you crave volumes of data and the tools and resources to analyze it? Do you delight at the prospect of discovering patterns and transforming data into actionable insights? Do you love working collaboratively with intelligent, energetic, no-nonsense colleagues? Are you as nice as you are brilliant? If you've answered ""yes"" to all four questions, we'd like to introduce ourselves.

What You'll Do
--------------

At the core of LiveRamp's products is a massive graph (over a trillion edges) that connects the different anonymous identifiers for each person in the US, their online devices, and the identifiers that over a thousand different marketing platforms use to recognize them. As a LiveRamp Researcher, you'll analyze the complex connections in this graph that contains PBs of data from over a thousand different sources and perform quantitative statistical analysis to understand the structure of data. Further, you'll design and compute statistical models for interpreting this data. We prefer simple models so that we can understand the patterns that they capture, although we have used multilayer neural networks when needed.

To work with this massive dataset, you'll learn cutting-edge big data tools (e.g., PySpark). You'll get elastic compute resources on Google Cloud Platform and we'll trust you to use your judgment in renting large amounts of computing resources as needed (we've used up 20k cores concurrently in our DataProc clusters).

Using the results of your investigations, you'll further develop our conceptual framework for understanding LiveRamp's identity graph, including new terminology, metrics, models, visualizations, and reports. Further, you'll apply this conceptual framework to develop proposals for new data refinement strategies that filter out suspect connections to further enhance the quality of LiveRamp's identity graph. You'll get dedicated coaching from seasoned Research Data Scientists.

Types of projects you'll work on:
---------------------------------


Explore and quantify the reach and accuracy implications for incorporating new sources of identity data into our graph.
Apply modeling to quantify the strength of connections within our graph.
Quantify the holes in our identity graph. I.e., what types of consumers are we missing identity data for?
Create reports and presentations to share your results with our stakeholders.

What You'll Need to Have
------------------------


Ph.D. in a quantitative field or three years of research experience (no exceptions).
Strong grasp of statistics and modeling techniques.
Solid experience with Python, R or other statistical toolsets (we use Python).
Strong technical communication, both written and verbal.
Type S(tartup) personality: smart, ethical, friendly, hard-working and proactive (no exceptions).
Desire to work in San Francisco. We will relocate you if necessary.

What We'll Give in Return
-------------------------


Exceptionally nice and smart teammates
Stock
A generous training budget for whatever you want to develop your skills (e.g., conferences, classes, and books).
Unlimited paid time off
A dog friendly office
Catered meals & stocked kitchen
401K Matching

Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company. EA delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets.
Here in EA's Data Science group within Global Analytics and Insights, we're always looking for new members to help expand our horizon, to move our communal thought process. Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.

Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.

We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.

Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!

We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality. At EA, we live the “work hard/play hard” credo every day.

Every day, millions of families turn to Common Sense for trusted advice and unbiased ratings. We offer the largest library of independent age-based and educational ratings and reviews for everything your kids want to watch, play, read, and learn. Our movie and TV ratings are available on Comcast, DirecTV, Netflix, and many other partner networks, helping families and kids make smart media choices. Through our schools program, we provide educators with a curriculum that teaches the essential digital citizenship and literacy skills every student needs to succeed. More than 600,000 registered educators and 55,000 schools use our ratings and curriculum and content. We also work with policymakers, industry leaders, legislators, and a grassroots community of concerned parents and teachers to improve the media, tech, and education landscape for kids, families, and schools.

Common Sense Media is actively looking for a self-motivated, mission-driven data analyst/scientist to join our team. The data analyst/scientist will work alongside marketing, product and engineering, development, and other departments to set up and deliver advanced analytics and data-driven insights to stakeholders. The main work tool will be Looker; we need someone who can work with the business users/analyst types in different departments, helping them understand and deliver the dashboards and queries that inform their decisions.

Your primary task will be to help increase membership and donations to the organization. You will help test different approaches, messages, and benefits as we come up with the most successful offering to either pursue a paid membership, membership-plus-voluntary-donation, or similar offering to make this an important revenue source for the organization. Experience in driving membership and conversion around membership in previous positions in a plus.

The data analyst/scientist will be supported by a devops engineer who will set up and manage the central data repository, a UX expert who will help define the user needs, a technical project manager, a Salesforce administrator who manages that platform, and other staff members who will help them work with the rest of the organization. The position will report to the CTO/head of product and work closely with marketing. Initially, you will be a one-person team, with a lot of support, but expected to be a leader and evangelist.

The first months will be spent setting up the tool and helping to educate and train various members across departments in using Looker and, over a longer period, training them in becoming as self-sufficient as possible in using the tool.

Essential Duties:

Help train stakeholders and business analysts in other departments in defining and using Looker to think analytically about asking questions; solving their problems; and meeting KPIs with the primary focus on membership growth.
Write the SQL queries and, where needed, LookML code to define dashboards and analytic frameworks within Looker, combining data from multiple sources, including Drupal SQL databases, Google Analytics, and Salesforce.
Evangelize within the organization about the use of data to inform decisions and formulate questions in a way that data can be used to help find the answers and increase membership, donations, or some combination of the two.
Define KPIs, build dashboards, and create reports on the chosen platform in consultation with various team members, primarily marketing, product, and development to begin with.
Respond to operational needs by providing analytical support.
Establish and maintain a system to roll up qualitative data gathered from various sources (customer support requests, user comments, educator outreach) into digestible quantitative insights that support, initially and primarily, membership acquisition.
Perform sufficient qualitative research to gain insights into data trends. (Get data from individual users to show the ""why"" and ""how"" for the quantitative data's ""how much"" and ""how often."") Use that research to become an expert in the end-to-end needs of our users.
Essential Requirements:

2+ years of experience in business or data analysis with experience in identity, ecommerce, online payments, education, reviews, or the gaming industry.
Excellent interpersonal skills and ability to train and guide others.
Bachelor's degree or comparable experience required in a quantitative discipline such as mathematics, statistics, economics, engineering, operations research, computer science, or quantitative psychology.
Strong analytical skills including the ability to interpret and manipulate large structured data to develop recommendations and analysis.
Proficiency with SQL, tools such as Tableau or Looker, and other statistical/reporting packages.
Self-motivated; works well both independently and as part of an agile team.
Preferred Experience:

Master's degree required, in a quantitative discipline such as mathematics, statistics, economics, engineering, operations research, computer science, or quantitative psychology.
Experience in developing, driving, and supporting membership/donation models.
Experience with console development for analytical platforms.
Understanding of other Big Data tools.
Experience with visualization tools and platforms.
Experience integrating third-party data into Looker, such as Salesforce.
Note: For the right candidate, we would be willing to provide additional training as needed in use of Looker and data science.

Founded by Adam Pisoni, the co-founder and former CTO of Yammer, Abl ( https://ablschools.com/ ) is an early-stage edtech company developing a data insights platform for K12 principals.

In summer 2017, we launched our first product, a next-generation Master Scheduler that allows school leaders to build student-centric schedules. Master schedules are the pulse of school operations. Current scheduling tools are not designed to help school leaders meet the needs and personal interests of every student.

The Role

We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You'll collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers, and school leaders to build software features that help schools overcome complex logistical challenges.

As a Data Scientist at Abl, your work will immediately improve equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype, with engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.

Recent data science projects include:

Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule
Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule
Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices
Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking

The Team

Our product research and development team is small, passionate, and inclusive. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.

As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.

Responsibilities


Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, and predictive models)
Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl's product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production
Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling
Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools
Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources
Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate
Determine how to evaluate equity, or fairness, for students and for teachers
Propose metrics for evaluating the overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules' ability to meet school leader priorities
Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school data

Qualifications


Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)
Proficiency in writing SQL queries
Ability and desire to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences (e.g., in writing, through reporting tools, and at in-person presentations)
Experience with cleaning, structuring, and transforming data via ETL processes
Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models

Company Culture

Abl employees all share a passion for revolutionizing education through school design, whether or not they have prior experience working in the field. We value the diversity of background and thought. We strive to create a safe and supportive environment where trust, communication, creativity, and humility are valued as highly as technical skills. We believe shared ownership builds a more resilient company, and we tackle hard problems, together. If that sounds like your dream work environment, we look forward to hearing from you."

The first Data Scientist at Finrise will play an imperative role in enabling patient financing for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. You recognize that 56% of Americans with a less than ideal FICO Score need new ways to evaluate creditworthiness in efficient and holistic ways.

Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

What you'll be doing
Designing and developing core machine learning infrastructure
Conducting statistical analyses to assess the value of new data points and vendors
Building and deploying production risk models to improve Finrise patient underwriting
