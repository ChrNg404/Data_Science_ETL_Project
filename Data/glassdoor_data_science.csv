Airbnb has become a global platform that connects travelers and hosts from over 34,000 cities. As such, experimentation is core to our growing business. We want to take a scientific approach to decision-making through careful hypothesis generation and testing and drive actions/refine strategies through insights from experimental analysis.

Our inference data scientists are deep in understanding the complications of running experiments in a two-sided marketplace, power analysis and stopping criterions, and statistical models to improve power/significance. Another interesting problem space is understanding what to do when we are unable to conduct experiments. How do we understand the impact of something new?

Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a projects cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.

Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.

We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.

Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.

But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a platform that’s solving those problems. We’ve been helping corporate R&D teams be more efficient with the 1.5 Trillion dollars invested annually.

Our Team

We’re a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded, team of self-starters who show up every day for the same reason: to create an impact on the way the world innovates. Our aim this year at Brightidea is to make it our Best Year Ever and we plan to accomplish that through our creative, focused, ambitious, and humble approach to change the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone entering our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you can identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful than this could be the perfect team for you to add your contributions to and shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",Glassdoor,San Francisco, CA,Data Scientist

At Carvana, we sell cars, but we're not salespeople. Since 2013, we've been making it our mission to change the way people buy cars. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way, so we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T"").

With the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device. All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right). By putting customer satisfaction at the core of our business, we've built a no-pressure, no-haggle online car buying experience that saves our customers time and money.

You'll need to be a great communicator, a brand ambassador, and possess the know-how to get the job done.

We select bright people, willing to roll up their sleeves, take on new assignments, and juggle many things at once.

In return for your hard work, you'll have an opportunity to work at one of the fastest growing and creative technology companies around, as well as help us promote a life-changing product and develop a world-class team every day.

In our downtime, we have ping pong and corn hole (or ""bags,"" depending on where you're from) tournaments. However, the pace is pretty quick around here, so you'll need to be prepared to keep up.

Everything from understanding the trends in our subscriber growth to shaping our product strategy through A/B testing and more happens within our team and we need top data scientists to help the business deliver the best possible product to our SMB customers. We are growing rapidly and need great people to support our analytical efforts in both Product and Marketing.

What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem. Its also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.
